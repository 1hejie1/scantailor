# About

Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file. Scanning, optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this project.

Scan Tailor is Free Software (which is more than just freeware). It's written in C++ with Qt and released under the General Public License version 3. We develop both Windows and GNU/Linux versions.

This project started in late 2007 and by mid 2010 it reached production quality.  It's being used not just by enthusiasts, but also by libraries and other institutions.  A few books processed by Scan Tailor even ended up on Google Books.
